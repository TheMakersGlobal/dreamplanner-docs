## Overview

The tax calculation process determines the amount of tax owed based on annual income, applying predefined tax brackets and deductions. The calculation follows a progressive tax system and adheres to the regulations outlined by the **IRD Sri Lanka**.

---

## Variables Used

### 1. **`annualIncome`**
- The total annual income subject to tax.
- **Type**: Positive number.
- **Example**: `3,000,000`

### 2. **`ANNUAL_DEDUCTION`**
- A fixed deduction applied to the income before tax calculations begin.
- **Value**: `1,200,000`

### 3. **`TAX_BRACKETS`**
- A progressive structure that defines tax rates for incremental portions of income.
- **Structure**:
  - For the first `500,000`: Tax at `6%`
  - For the next `500,000`: Tax at `12%`
  - For the next `500,000`: Tax at `18%`
  - For the next `500,000`: Tax at `24%`
  - For the next `500,000`: Tax at `30%`
  - Remaining income: Tax at `36%`

---

## Calculation Steps

1. **Apply Annual Deduction**
   - Subtract `ANNUAL_DEDUCTION` from the total `annualIncome`.
   - If the remaining income is less than or equal to `0`, the tax is `0`.

   **Example**:  
   For `annualIncome = 3,000,000`,  
   Remaining income = `3,000,000 - 1,200,000 = 1,800,000`.

2. **Iterate Over Tax Brackets**
   - For each bracket:
     1. Take the smaller value between the remaining income and the current bracket limit.
     2. Multiply it by the respective tax rate.
     3. Add this to the total tax.
     4. Subtract the taxed amount from the remaining income.
   - Stop when the remaining income is `0`.

   **Example**:  
   Remaining income: `1,800,000`  
   - First `500,000` taxed at `6%` â†’ `30,000`  
   - Next `500,000` taxed at `12%` â†’ `60,000`  
   - Next `500,000` taxed at `18%` â†’ `90,000`  
   - Remaining `300,000` taxed at `24%` â†’ `72,000`  
   **Total Tax**: `252,000`

3. **Round the Result**
   - The total tax is rounded to the nearest whole number.

## Edge Cases

1. **Income Less Than or Equal to `0`**
   - **Result**: Tax is `0`.
   - **Reason**: No taxable income exists.

2. **Income Less Than or Equal to `ANNUAL_DEDUCTION`**
   - **Result**: Tax is `0`.
   - **Reason**: Deduction fully offsets the income.

3. **High Incomes**
   - All brackets are applied progressively.
   - Any income above `3,000,000` is taxed at the highest rate of `36%`.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Low Income
**Annual Income**: `1,000,000`  
**Deduction**: `1,200,000`

### Scenario 2: Mid-Level Income
**Annual Income**: `3,000,000`  
**Deduction**: `1,200,000`  
**Taxable Income**: `1,800,000`  
**Tax Calculation**:
- First `500,000` taxed at `6%` â†’ `30,000`
- Next `500,000` taxed at `12%` â†’ `60,000`
- Next `500,000` taxed at `18%` â†’ `90,000`
- Remaining `300,000` taxed at `24%` â†’ `72,000`
**Total Tax**: `252,000`

### Scenario 3: High Income
**Annual Income**: `6,000,000`  
**Deduction**: `1,200,000`  
**Taxable Income**: `4,800,000`  
**Tax Calculation**:
- First `500,000` taxed at `6%` â†’ `30,000`
- Next `500,000` taxed at `12%` â†’ `60,000`
- Next `500,000` taxed at `18%` â†’ `90,000`
- Next `500,000` taxed at `24%` â†’ `120,000`
- Next `500,000` taxed at `30%` â†’ `150,000`
- Remaining `2,300,000` taxed at `36%` â†’ `828,000`
**Total Tax**: `1,278,000`

## Notes

- The tax calculation follows a **progressive system**, meaning higher portions of income are taxed at higher rates.
- Tax brackets and deductions should be updated to reflect changes in tax policies.
